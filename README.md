\# 🌞 Project 4: LDR-Based Automatic LED Light System



This Arduino project uses an LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) to detect ambient light and turn an LED ON or OFF accordingly — just like an automatic streetlight.



---



\## 🔧 Components Used

\- Arduino UNO

\- LDR (Light Sensor)

\- 10K Resistor

\- LED

\- Breadboard

\- Jumper Wires



---



\## 🧠 Working

\- In darkness, the LDR detects low light → LED turns ON

\- In bright light, the LED turns OFF

\- Smart and energy-efficient system simulation

\## 🧾 Code

The Arduino sketch is available in this repo as `CODE\\\_LDR\\\_AUTOMATIC.ino`



---



\## 🧪 Output

\- LED lights up in low light (cover the LDR with your finger to test)

\- Turns off automatically in bright light
